# frozen_string_literal: true

# We need unique identifiers for cards, and generally we use <set_code>/<collector_number>
# This means we must force collector numbers to be unique within each set.
#
# For some sets this isn't true, so we fix them (like planes, vanguard, Unset variants etc.)
#
# For sets without Gatherer numbers we use magiccards.info numbers, as that makes debugging easier.
# Originally it was done for debugging, now mostly because there's no point changing what works.
#
# For cards with multiple printings it's not obvious how to get them arranged so pics match,
# but it's not a huge deal.
#
# By the way ordering by multiverseid would probably be more sensible
# (alpha starts with Ankh of Mishra, not Animate Dead), but compatibilty etc.
